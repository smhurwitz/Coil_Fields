This repository contains a number of methods written in C++ to compute quantities such as the self-force, self-inductance, and magnetic field for various coils; all formulas referenced in the code are found or can be determined from those presented in (Hurwitz, Landreman, and Antonsen; 2023). By contrast, most of the data analysis for the research was performed in the Jupyter notebook `analysis.ipynb`. The data itself was largely obtained from the C++ code through the file `runner.cpp`, which provides methods for data export.
